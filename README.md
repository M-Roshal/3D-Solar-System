# 3D Solar System Visualization

## Project Overview
This project provides a 3D visualization of the solar system, illustrating the positions and movements of planets around the sun.

## Features
- Realistic rendering of planets and orbits.
- User controls to manipulate the view.
- Simulation of orbital mechanics based on gravitational interactions.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python solar_system.py
   ```

## Orbital Mechanics
The simulation uses Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation to calculate the movement of each planet. The position of each planet is updated in real-time based on its orbital parameters.
